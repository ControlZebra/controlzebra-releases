# Installation Guide

Before you open the installer, make sure that you disable the antivirus. Why? because the current app does not have code signature & it costs fairly high (Cost: $400-600/ year). 

## Instructions

### Step 1: 
Make sure you have downloaded the installer from official github release channel link. Here is the sample link: https://github.com/ControlZebra/controlzebra-releases/releases/download/[version]/control-zebra-amd64-installer.exe

### Step 2: Open the installer
The windows security will show you following pop-up. Click on **More Info**.

### Step 3: Allow to run
Next, click on **Run anyway**. This will bypass the windows security blocking.
