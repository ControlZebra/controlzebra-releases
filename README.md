# ControlZebra

ControlZebra is a desktop Git client built for industrial automation teams. It is currently under closed beta phase.

If you work with PLC logic, HMI projects, and electrical drawing PDFs, ControlZebra helps you track, compare, and merge changes without forcing your team to become Git experts.

## Why Controls Teams Choose ControlZebra

- **Visually familiar Git workflow** for engineers and technicians who prefer clear actions over command-line complexity.
- **Next Step Advisor** that guides users through what to do now (for example: `Start Tracking`, `Push Changes`, `Publish to Cloud`, or `I am ready to merge`).
- **Visual diff for PLC and PDF assets** so code and drawings can be reviewed in context, not as raw text.
- **Collaboration-ready flow** with branch history, merge review, and cloud publishing for team visibility.
- **Best-practice nudges in the background** to reduce risky commits to main branches and make conflict resolution understandable.

## What You Can Do in v0.0.1

- Track project folders with Git using guided setup.
- Open, inspect, and compare working changes and historical snapshots.
- Review ladder logic (`.l5x`, `.l5k`) with a dedicated viewer.
- Review PDF changes with a visual PDF diff viewer.
- View commit history in both compact list and branch graph formats.
- Publish repositories to GitHub and continue with local-first workflows.
- Merge changes with a guided flow: conflict check, review, resolve, and complete.

## Built for System Integrators

ControlZebra is designed for industrial automation engineers who handle revision-heavy deliverables, including:

- PLC and ladder logic programs
- Electrical drawings and PDF documentation
- Multi-person project handoffs across engineering, commissioning, and support

## Quick Start

1. Open your project folder.
2. Use **Next Step Advisor** to follow the recommended action.
3. Review visual diffs before merging or publishing.
4. Push and publish when you are ready to collaborate.

## Release Metadata Repository

This repository stores release metadata and automation scripts.

- Update files in `metadata/` for each release.
- Use files in `scripts/` for release automation.
